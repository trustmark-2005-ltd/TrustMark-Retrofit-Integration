# TrustMark Retrofit Integration

First Published April 22


> PAS 2035/2030 2023 has been published by BSI and is [available here](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/pas-2035-2030/).

> [!NOTE]
> PAS 2035 [2023] is now available for use. The TrustMark Retrofit Integration API has been updated to support the new PAS 2035 [2023] standard, the change is non-breaking and PAS 2035 [2019] is assumed by default. The API will continue to support the previous PAS 2035 [2019] standard until further notice. For example requests see the [Example Requests](#example-requests).


> Supporting [Sandbox Swagger](https://api.sandbox.retrofitintegration.data-hub.org.uk/swagger/index.html)

## Introduction

The TrustMark Retrofit.IntegrationApi (RIAPI) allows users to integrate with the new TrustMark Retrofit platform which has been developed in time for ECO4 launch (July 2022).

### Overview
* A Retrofit Project will be created.
* A Retrofit project will require a Retrofit Assessment.
* It will be possible for a Retrofit Assessor to lodge an Assessment or for the Retrofit Coordinator to create it if appropriate.
* Retrofit Assessments will be accompanied with RdSAP xml data.
* Before a Project id can be generated, certain requirements must be met.
* Defects in the property can be recorded at both Assessment and mid Project.
* Designs must indicate who created them, which measures they cover and which property defects are addressed.
* A Project can be completed and lodged in stages.
* Each lodged stage can contain one or more measure.
* To complete a project an updated RdSAP xml must be provided.

Additional supporting documentation such as the Data Dictionary and Structured Data Model will be published at https://www.trustmark.org.uk/data-warehouse
ECO 4 specific information can be found at: https://www.trustmark.org.uk/tradespeople/eco4

### Principles

TrustMark will provide access to a ‘Sandbox’ environment for development and integration testing. Before access to the live environment can be provided you must successfully complete projects into the Sandbox environment that represent a number of core scenarios.

Once TrustMark has validated the test projects a Data Sharing Agreement will be issued and must be signed before the live keys are issued.


### Service Fees

Payable by the party signing the Data Sharing Agreement.

| Service                  | Fee (+VAT)               | Notes                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Setup                    | £1500                    |                                                                  |
| Annual Service Charge    | £1500                    |  Annual increase capped at CPI +3%                               |
| Price per activity       | 1.5% of transaction cost |  Calculated monthly based upon lodgement fees payable to TrustMark by the lodging party |


## Key Concepts

### Data

The RIAPI focuses on allowing Assessment, Project and Lodgement data to be submitted at key stages. Sequence numbers (5) and (6) are optional.


| Sequence | Area       | Name     | Description                                                                                | Endpoint         |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1        | Assessment | [Submit](#assessmentsubmit)   | Creates a new Retrofit Assessment, generating an AssessmentReference. If you are not a Retrofit Assessor or are using an existing Retrofit Assessment you will need to see [Assessment](#assessment)                       | AssessmentSubmit |
| 2        | Project    | [Start](#projectstart)    | Creates a new Retrofit Project using an AssessmentReference, generating a ProjectReference | ProjectStart     |
| 3        | Lodgement  | [Submit](#lodgementsubmit)   | Create a new Lodgment using a ProjectReference. A lodgement contains one or more measures.                                             | LodgementSubmit  |
| 4        | Project    | [Complete](#projectcomplete) | Completes the existing Project using a ProjectReference                                    | ProjectComplete  |
| (5)      | Project    | [Void](#projectvoid) | Voids an inprogress or draft project using a ProjectReference                                  | ProjectVoid  |
| (6)      | Lodgement  | [Amend](#lodgementamend) | Amends measures in a completed lodgement                              | LodgementAmend  |
| (7)      | Project  | [Amend](#projectamend) | Amends a project final RdSAP file                              | ProjectAmend  |

File uploads can be preloaded and attached during submission of the Assessment, Project, Lodgement and also as a standalone Supporting Document attaching to an existing Project. See [FileUploadToken](#fileuploadtoken)

Lodged Measures can be amended when needed using the [LodgementAmend](#lodgementamend)

### UPRN Check

Before a Project can be Started or Completed checks will be made against the processing project's UPRN. Any existing data within the TrustMark Retrofit Portal held against that UPRN under the same scope of funding will be checked, if any data exists the request will be initially rejected with a 422 response code and a message code. This allows the integrating software provider to notify their user before fully completing their action.

The following message codes exist:
| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| UPRN_EXISTS_FIRST | You have created another {{project_type}} project at this property. Ensure that you can meet the eligibility criteria before proceeding. |
| UPRN_EXISTS_THIRD | Another {{project_type}} project exists at this property. Ensure that you can meet the eligibility criteria before proceeding. |
| UPRN_EXISTS_FIRST_AND_THIRD | You and another party have created {{project_type}} projects at this property. Ensure that you can meet the eligibility criteria before proceeding. |

This checking exists for the following project types:
 * GB Insulation Scheme (GBIS)

To accept this message and proceed with the request must be resubmitted with the `acceptUPRNCheck` attribute set to `true`.


### Version

A version value of `2022-04-01` should be supplied.

### ClientRequestToken

A unique token to be provided by you to identify the request, these will expire after 10 minutes. Use to ensure that the request is idempotent.

### Identity

You will need to generate an API Key from the Retrofit Portal. You can do this by accessing your `Account` on the bottom left of the sidebar in the portal and then clicking the `API` tab and following the instructions displayed.

#### Http Header

The `tm-api-key` portion of the API Key needs to be supplied as a http header with each request.

#### Body TrustmarkId

The `trustmarkId` portion of the API Key needs to be supplied in the identity attribute of the request.

```json
{
  "version": "2022-04-01",
  "identity": {
    "trustmarkId": "api-e5b3e97b-b95e-467f-b082-60fcab47ec6d"
  },
  "clientRequestToken" : "2341716e-23fc-4d6f-b833-f945aa6f5a76",
  "request": {
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Third Party Submissions

If you require Third Party Access to submit data on behalf of another TrustMark registered business (TMLN) you will need to ensure they provide permission for you to do so.

You will need to supply your `Retrofit Account ID` to them. You can find your `Retrofit Account ID` by accessing your `Account` on the bottom left of the sidebar in the portal and then clicking the `Details` tab.

The business will then need to log into their account, access `Account` on the bottom left of the sidebar in the portal and then clicking the `Third Party Access` tab, enter your `Retrofit Account ID` and click `Grant Access`.

### Response Codes

TrustMark uses [HTTP response status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) to indicate the success or failure of your API requests.

#### 2xx

Success status codes confirm that your request worked as expected.

#### 400 Bad Request

Almost likely that a missing or malformed request has been provided, often due to incorrect data-types being provided. Check your request with the Swagger documentation.

#### 422 Unprocessable Entity

A detailed reason will be provided to indicate how to resolve processing the information provided. For example;

```json
{
  "message": "Ventilation.ExistingVentilationProvided 'string' has an invalid option"
}
```

#### 409 Conflict

The [ClientRequestToken](#clientrequesttoken) has been seen with the timeframe, deeming it a duplicate request.

### 429 Too Many Requests

You have exceeded your usage quota of requests.

### 5xx

Error status codes indicate an error. Whilst in this early stage we would always appreciate feedback and your http request used to cause the error.

## Endpoints

### FileUploadToken

> POST /Data/FileUploadToken

You can upload files to attach to an Assessment, Project or Lodgement. In order to do this you must first request an File Upload Token - this will give you a time bound link to PUT a file to S3.

The body looks like this and all you need to supply in the request is the filename.

```json
{
  "version": "2022-04-01",
  "identity": {
    "trustmarkId": "api-e5b3e97b-b95e-467f-b082-60fcab47ec6d"
  },
  "clientRequestToken" : "8dfb4810-596c-4a52-9910-27de7a1e8bac",
  "request": {
    "filename": "TestRA.pdf"
  }
}
```

The response gives two key pieces back, the first is the `uploadUrl`. You need to do a binary PUT with your file to that url provided, this is limited to 5 minutes before expiring.

```json
{
  "fileUploadToken": "rac-0c815e54-429d-40d8-98b2-37f8c7913181t20220426t9959c6afec404be5b28ff57544acb6a2t132954467702961840",
  "uploadUrl": "https://uat-retrofit-files-api.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/*********-TestRA.pdf?X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Algorithm=*****&X-Amz-Credential=******************&X-Amz-Date=*******&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=********"
}
```

The `fileUploadToken` you will retain and use as part of a future request.


### AssessmentSubmit

Allows for a Retrofit Assessment to be submitted, generating an AssessmentReference.

The owner of the Assessment must have enough credit to cover any fees for this transaction.

    "trustmarkId": "string"
  },
  "request": {
    "certificateNumber": "string"
  }
}
```

#### Response

HTTP 200 OK. This will not return the MCS certificate, but will store it in the TrustMark API for a subsequent call to the [LodgementSubmit](#lodgementsubmit) or [StandaloneLodgementSubmit](#standalonelodgementsubmit) calls.

#### MCS Measures and Testing

In order to use MCS measures you must provide an MCS Certificate Reference that can be validated. Therefore, the certificate reference must exist in the MCS Testing Database and the returned certificate must have a matching property postcode and technology.

`MCS-01109079-R` is a valid testing mcsCertificateReference value and must match against a postcode of `IP7 6RL` and an MCS technology of `2`, for example `DW-305` would be a valid measure type.

## RdSAP Files

RdSAP files are required at Assessment and Project Completion stages. The xml content of the file must be supplied in the fields, if you are exploring the API and need an online tool to escape characters then https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html works well.

TrustMark is not responsible for external websites and their functionality or security, we advise that only non-personal test data is used with any of the tools listed.

## Visualising

If you'd like to visualise the data [JSON Visio (jsonvisio.com)](https://jsonvisio.com/editor) illustrates data on graphs well and can help with the understanding of the Assessment, Project and Lodgement requests.

## Certificates

Certificates will be returned as Base64 - https://base64.guru/converter/decode/file and when decoded a PDF.

## Integration Testing

Before access to live API keys can be granted, integrators must sign a Data Sharing Agreement and successfully complete testing of their integration.
The document below provides an overview of core testing scenarios and includes the declarations that must be built into your application and evidenced.
[API Testcases and Declarations](https://cms.trustmark.org.uk/media/sbmhxelb/retrofit-api-testscenarios.xlsx)

## Third Party Lodgement Permission
To lodge work as a Software Provider on behalf on a TrustMark Registered Business they must give you permission to lodge on their behalf. This can be achieved by:
- Logging into your retrofit portal account and retrieving your Retrofit Account Id.
- Providing it to the TrustMark Business
- They log into their portal and enter the Retrofit Account Id in the 'Third Party Access' tab and 'Grant Access'

## TrustMark Licence (TMLN) TradeCheck

You can request an API Key to use the `TradeCheck Service` provided by TrustMark that will enable you to request trades that a TMLN is registered for.
